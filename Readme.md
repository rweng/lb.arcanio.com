# LogBook

LogBook (http://lb.arcanio.com) is a simple Angular 2 application.
It can be used as diary, decision log, or for whatever you whant to keep track of.
This application is nowhere near ready and I developed it only for toying with pouchdb.
However, if you can imagine using s.th. like this feel free to create issues with feature requests.
